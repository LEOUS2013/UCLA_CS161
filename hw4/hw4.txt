The graph pictured in the spec (graph1.txt) is not satisfiable using 3 colors.
It is, however, satisfiable with 4 colors. This is because the highest degree
node has a degree of 4. Using the colors red, green, blue, and yellow, a
solution can be defined as follows:

   Node 1: Red
   Node 2: Green
   Node 3: Red
   Node 4: Blue
   Node 5: Yellow
   Node 6: Green
   Node 7: Blue

The second graph (graph2.txt) is only satisfiable using 8 or more colors.
