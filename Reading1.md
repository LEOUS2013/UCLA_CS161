## Chapter 1: Introduction
### 1.1 What is AI?
* Possible definition: machines that think and act rationally
#### 1.1.1 The Turing Test
* A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
  * To pass, a computer needs:
    * Natural language processing
    * Knowledge representation
    * Automated reasoning
    * Machine learning
* The "total" Turing Test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects "through the hatch". To pass this, the computer needs computer vision to perceive objects and robotics to manipulate objects and move.
