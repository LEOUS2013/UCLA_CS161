## Search Terminology 
* *Fringe* (also referred to as the *frontier*) - Nodes waiting to be considered by algorithm
* *Expand* - For an existing node in the frontier; generate all of its children
* *Branching factor* (*b*)- Number of children that can possibly be generated by a given parent
* *Depth* (*d*) - Cost of the best solution
* *Max depth* (*m*) - Cost of worst-case scenario
## Tree Search
Pseudocode example using terminology defined above:
```
frontier = { initial state }
loop do
  if frontier is empty, return Fail
  node = choose to remove from frontier
  if node is goal state, return node's state
  frontier += node.expand()
```
## Search Algorithms
**This table will appear on midterm.**

|  Algorithm | Complete? |         Time        |       Space      | Optimal? |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|
| BFS        | Yes       | O(b<sup>d</sup>)    | b<sup>d</sup>    |          |
| "Dumb" BFS | Yes       | O(b<sup>d+1</sup>)  | b<sup>d+1</sup>  |          |
|            |           |                     |                  |          |
|            |           |                     |                  |          |
