## Heuristics
* *Pattern*: partial specification of a permutation (or a state). In the case of the N-Puzzle, the tiles occupying certain locations are unspecified (blank).
* *Target pattern*: a partial specification of the goal state.
* *Pattern database*: a collection of solutions to sub-problems that must be achieved to solve the problem.
* *Unary constraint*: a constraint on a single variable (ex. `x ≠ 4`). 
* *Binary constraint*: a constraint over a pair of variables (ex. `x ≠ y`)
